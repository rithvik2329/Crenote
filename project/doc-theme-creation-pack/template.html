      <h1>The afterglow of the daylight</h1><p>In addition to those fine engravings from Garnery, there are two other French engravings worthy of note, by <i>some one</i> who subscribes himself "H. Durand." One of them, though not precisely adapted to our present purpose, nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts. It is a quiet noon-scene among the isles of the Pacific; a <b>French whaler</b> anchored, inshore, in a calm, and lazily taking water on board; the loosened sails of the ship&nbsp;<span class="emoji emoji-sailboat" title=":sailboat:"><span class="emoji-text">:sailboat:</span></span>&nbsp;, and the long leaves of the palms in the background, both drooping together in the breezeless air. The effect is very fine, when considered with reference to</p><p>Finally there were but three of us left, a great green <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oplurus_grandidieri" target="_blank">warrior of some far northern horde</a>, Kantos Kan, and myself.</p><p>They say that men who have seen the world, thereby become quite at ease in manner, quite self-possessed in company. Not always, though: Ledyard, the great New England traveller, and <b>Mungo Park</b>, the Scotch one; of all men,</p><p></p><ul><li>they possessed the least assurance in the parlor.</li><li>But <b><i>perhaps the mere crossing of Siberia&nbsp;</i></b><span class="emoji emoji-snowflake" title=":snowflake:"><span class="emoji-text">:snowflake:</span></span>&nbsp;in a edge drawn by dogs as Ledyard did,</li><li>or the taking a <u>long solitary walk</u> on an empty stomach, in the negro heart of Africa,</li></ul><p></p><p>which was the sum of poor Mungo's performancesâ€”this kind of travel, I say, may not be the very best mode of attaining a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Petrasso" target="_blank">high social polish</a>. Still, <u>for the most part</u>, that sort of thing is to be had anywhere.</p><blockquote>Why not, after all ? It's a chance&nbsp;perhaps the only one</blockquote><p>He had commenced by saying to himself, "What folly!" and then he repeated, "Why not, after all? It's a chance <strike>perhaps the only one</strike>; and with such sots!" Thinking thus, he slipped, with the suppleness of a serpent&nbsp;<span class="emoji emoji-snake" title=":snake:"><span class="emoji-text">:snake:</span></span>&nbsp;, to the lowest branches, the ends of which bent almost to the ground.</p><p></p><h2>Twenty minutes before nine</h2><p>Phileas Fogg and his servant seated themselves in a first-class carriage at <u><i><b>twenty minutes</b></i></u> before nine; five minutes later the whistle screamed, and the train slowly glided out of the station.</p><p><img src="assets/img/sun-blue.png?nocache2650=1474034571778"></p><p>The occasional howling of the Martians had ceased; they took up their positions in the huge crescent about their <b>cylinders in absolute silence</b>. It was a crescent with twelve miles between its horns. Never since the devising of gunpowder was the beginning of a battle so still. To us and to an observer about Ripley it would have had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergapten" target="_blank">precisely the same effect</a>--the Martians seemed in solitary possession of the <strike>darkling</strike> night, lit only as it was by the slender moon, the stars, the afterglow of the daylight, and <b>the ruddy glare</b> from St. George's Hill and the woods of Painshill.</p><blockquote>They left the cottage and walked through the trees</blockquote><p>They left the cottage and walked through the trees until they <i>found a little spring</i> of clear water, where Dorothy drank and bathed and ate her breakfast. She saw there was not much bread left in the basket, and the girl was thankful the Scarecrow did not have to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_opinion_polling_for_the_Spanish_general_election,_2016" target="_blank">eat anything</a>, for there was scarcely enough for herself and Toto for the day.</p><p>4<sup>2</sup> = 16,&nbsp;Go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty mansion, and your question will be answered. Yes; all these brave houses and flowery gardens came from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans&nbsp;<span class="emoji emoji-ocean" title=":ocean:"><span class="emoji-text">:ocean:</span></span>&nbsp;. One and all, they were harpooned and dragged up <b><i>hither from the bottom of the sea</i></b>. Can Herr Alexander perform a feat like that?</p><h3>This wild outbreak</h3><p>This wild outbreak on the part of Sola so greatly surprised and shocked the other women, that, after a few words of general reprimand, they all lapsed into silence and were soon asleep. One thing the episode had accomplished was to assure me of Sola's friendliness toward <b>the C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="emoji emoji-pill" title=":pill:"><span class="emoji-text">:pill:</span></span>&nbsp;poor girl, and also to convince me that :</p><p><ol><li>I had been extremely fortunate in falling into her hands</li><li>rather than those</li><li>of some of the other females.<br></li></ol></p><p>I knew that she was fond of me, and now that I had discovered that she hated cruelty and barbarity I was confident that I could depend upon her to aid me and the girl captive to escape, provided of course that such a thing was within the range of possibilities.</p><p><iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/57Hj4NXqv0A" width="560" height="315" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"They are monstrous beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers <span class="emoji emoji-tiger" title=":tiger:"><span class="emoji-text">:tiger:</span></span>," replied the Lion, "and with claws so long and sharp that they could tear me in two as easily as I could kill Toto. I'm terribly afraid <span class="emoji emoji-scream" title=":scream:"><span class="emoji-text">:scream:</span></span>&nbsp;of the Kalidahs."</p><p><iframe src="https://player.twitch.tv/?video=v89152827" width="560" height="315" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"But," he continued, in his fierce guttural tones, "if you run off with the red girl it is I who shall have to account to Tal Hajus; it is I who shall have to face Tars Tarkas, and either demonstrate my right to command, or the metal from my dead carcass will go to a better man, for such is the custom of the Tharks.</p><p>"And you can't see these germ-things, Granser," Hare-Lip objected, "and here you gabble, gabble, gabble about them as if they was anything, when they're nothing at all. Anything you can't see, ain't, that's what. Fighting things that ain't with things that ain't! They must have been all fools in them days. That's why they croaked. I ain't goin' to believe in such rot, I tell you that."</p><h4>"So he is," said the green man</h4><p>"So he is," said the green man, "and he rules the Emerald City wisely and well. But to those who are not honest, or who approach him from curiosity, he is most terrible, and few have ever dared ask to see his face. I am the Guardian of the Gates, and since you demand to see the Great Oz I must take you to his Palace. But first you must put on the spectacles."</p><h5>It was this, as much as anything</h5><p>It was this, as much as anything, that gave people courage, and I suppose the new arrivals from Woking also helped to restore confidence. At any rate, as the dusk came on a slow, intermittent movement upon the sand pits began, a movement that seemed to gather force as the stillness of the evening about the cylinder remained unbroken. Vertical black figures in twos and threes would advance, stop, watch, and advance again, spreading out as they did so in a thin irregular crescent that promised to enclose the pit in its attenuated horns. I, too, on my side began to move towards the pit.</p><h6>At last the Mouse</h6><p>At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out, 'Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I'LL soon make you dry enough!' They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.</p>
